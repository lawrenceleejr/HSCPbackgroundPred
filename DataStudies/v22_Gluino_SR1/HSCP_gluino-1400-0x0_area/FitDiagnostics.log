>> Found 19 floating parameters
>> The following parameters are protected in the event of negative eigenvalues: r
>> Parameter r does not have a valid stencil and will be dropped
>> Verifying eigenvalues are all positive (iteration 0)
>> All eigenvalues are positive
>> Inverting Hessian...
>> Matrix inverted
>> Note: the following parameters were dropped as their ranges are either too narrow or the parameter has no effect on the NLL:
